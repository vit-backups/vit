## Secure, Permanent Wedding Album Backups for Professional Photographers and their Clients

## [Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jd8sy2ppL-jpfdgnvRvK0JNCUwk4Sn7kTyiDfgpQ_c/edit?usp=drive_web)

## [MVP Roadmap](https://github.com/vit-backups/vit/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3Amvp)

## Principle Assumptions

* Don't enshrine the uploader
  * Photographers will create 3 albums per week
  * An upload will take 3-6 hours on average
* The photographer needs to feel comfortable they are uploading the right thing, and back out easily if a mistake is made
* Jump to editing the title right after dropping a folder, pre-fill the album name with the folder name

## Random Notes

* Look at the Pitchfork player for upload progress inspiration
